## About
- Cloud service solution that makes it easy to ==establish a dedicated network connection from your data center to AWS==.
- This connection does not go over the public cloud.
	- When in transit, your network traffic remains on the AWS global network. (Reduces chances of bottlenecks and latency).
- When creating a new connection, you can choose a hosted connection provided by an [[AWS Direct Connect Delivery Partner]], or choose a dedicated connection from AWS.
- There are over 100 AWS Direct Connect locations wordwide.
- With [[AWS Direct Connect SiteLink]], you can send data between AWS Direct Connect locations to create private network connections between the offices and data centers in your global network.
