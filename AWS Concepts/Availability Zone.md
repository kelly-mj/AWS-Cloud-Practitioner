[[AWS Global Infrastructure]]

## About
- A single data center or group of data centers within a [[Region]].
- AZs are located tens of miles apart from each other. This is close enough to have low latency between AZs, but distant enough to reduce the chance of affecting multiple AZs if a disaster happens in a Region.
	- ==ie: AZs do not share a single point of failure==
- [[High Availability]] is achieved through the use of multiple AZs.

### Benefits
-
